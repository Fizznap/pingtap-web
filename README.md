# PingTap Web

PingTap is a simple web project built using **Next.js** as part of my journey in learning full-stack web development.

This project was created for my uncle with the help of AI tools, while I focus on understanding modern web development concepts and workflows.

- To learn how AI tools can assist during development while still writing and understanding code  
- To gain hands-on experience instead of only following tutorials
